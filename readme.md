# GOEnum
### A Bash Auto Enumeration Script that uses Go Tools to Enumerate. 

This script, inspired by TCM Security and "Sumrecon," enhances a Practical Ethical Hacking tutorial. It optimizes directory structures and tool installations, providing verification of tool presence for efficiency. It introduces a toggle for Amass usage and prompts for domain input, prioritizing user-friendliness. Ascii art adds flair. Work on this ongoing project continues.
